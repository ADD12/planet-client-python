## About

This is the complete guide to using the command-line interface (CLI) to Planet's
APIs. It's divided up into a number of sections, so you can jump right into 
the examples for an API you're interested in. If you're new to CLI's it should
provide all the information you need to work more directly with Planet's API's.

    This is a beta release. We encourage you to test your workflows rigorously. Based on your feedback, we may roll out additional updates to improve your experience. Please share your feedback with us on our [Planet Developers community channel](https://community.planet.com/developers-55).
